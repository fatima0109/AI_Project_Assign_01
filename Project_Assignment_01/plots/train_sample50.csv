"The President's News Conference in Hanoi, Vietnam","September 10, 2023",Joseph R. Biden,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-hanoi-vietnam-0,4,"Q. It's Aurelia End for AFP. I had a question on the climate crisis. You just mentioned the G-20. Just this week, the United States warned that if there is no phasing out of fossil fuels, it won't be possible to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement. There was no agreement at the G-20 on fossil fuels. How concerned are you about this lack of consensus?","It wasn't so much an agreement that we would try to meet the goals at the G-20. The United States is going to meet those goals, by the way. We're going to exceed those goals. A lot of other countries are as well.But we want to give those countries that don't have the economic wherewithal and did not cause the problem in the first placefor example, I met with Lula in Brazil.I started off way back in the eighties with a really fine Republican Senator named Dick Lugar. We said: Here's what we're going to do. If you owe us money, we're going to forgive your debt if you maintain your forest. Because they become carbon sinks. They're the things that take carbon out of the air.And so we're talking to what we should be goand the countries that cleared their land and put cattle on there and farming and did all the things thatand increased development, they, in fact, are the onesthe reasons whythe main reason why we've gotten as far down the road to disaster here as we have.And so it seemsand if we have the economic capacity, wethose nations should be getting together and providing help for the nations that don't have the wherewithal to do it, the economic wherewithal and the infrastructure wherewithal.And that's why, for example, I mentionedin the interest of time, I'll just mention Angola again. Angola has the capacity to generate megawatts of energy through solar energy. They don't have the economic means to do that. Isn't it in the interest of the whole world if they are, in fact, able to generate significant capacity to absorbto prevent carbon from being released in the air? I think that it is.So what we're trying to do is help those nations. Theand particularly in the Global South, where they're not as wealthy, where there are not as many opportunities to be able to deal with the things that they want to deal with.For exampleand I'll end with thisthere is more carbon absorbed from the atmosphere on a daily basisand I'll look to mymy friend, John Kerry, who'd forgotten more about this than most people knowcorrect me if I get this wrong, John, but I'm quite sure I'm rightand that is that there's more carbon observed [absorbed; White House correction] from the air into the Amazon region into the groundthe groundthan emitted in the entire United States on the same basis.Now, imagine if people go in and do what we did 150, 200, 250 years ago and cut down the forest and thestart farming in that area, no longer have that great carbon sink. Weyou know, it's goingit would be a gigantic problem.So we should be going to areas, whether it's in the Congo or other places, as the G-7 nations and as the wealthy G-20 nations, theand providing the kind of infrastructure they need to be able to benefit.And guess what? In addition to helping the environment overalland the only existential threat humanity faces even more frightening than a nuclear war is global warming going above 1.5 degrees in the next 2010 years. We'rethat'd be real trouble. There's no way back from that.And so there's a lot we can do in the meantime. For example, that pipelinethat railroad we're talking about going across from the middlefrom India, throughout the Middle East, and toacross the Mediterranean and all through Europe, that's going to have a hydrogen pipeline there. This is going to significantly reduce the amount of carbon emitted in the air, but it costs a lot of money to put that down. And the world is going to say it's in our interestcollective interest to do it.So I have notI have not given up at all on the notion that we're going to be able to, you knowhow can I say it? I think we can triple the renewable capacity foras it relates to global warmingby the year 20302030.Countries following the IRA playbook, which is the one we passedthe clean energy jobs, they're going to create manufacturing jobs.For example, as a consequence of what we've done, we have the mostwe have the mostwe have the strongest economy in the world today. Right now, today, the United States of America has the strongest economy in the worldin the world. Now, we've got more to do, but we have the strongest economy in the world.And one of the reasons we're doing itwe changed the mechanism of how we deal with this. And that is instead of trickle-down economythat is if the wealthy and the corporations do very well, everybody is going to do well.Well, the truth of the matter is, I've never bought that theory. But I think the times have changed, and a lot of leading economists are beginning to agree with mejust flat, straight-out academic economistsand that is: We should build economic growth from the middle out and the bottom up.When that happens, everybody does well. Everybody does well. The wealthy still do very, very well. They have no problem. You can still be a billionaire under that system as well. But you're going to start paying your taxes if I have anything to do it. That's a different issue.But all kidding asideso there'swe haveI think the other thing that's dawning on peoplemany of you who are foreign policy experts have been engaged for a long time. Did you ever think you'd be sitting at a G-20 conference where everyone was preoccupied with the notion of global warming? Not a joke. Did you ever think that?And there's amy brother loves havingthere's famous lines from movies that he always quotes. You know, it'sand one of them isthere's a movie about John Wayne. He's an Indian scout. And they're trying to get theI think it was the Apacheone of the great tribes of America back on the reservation.And he's standing with a Union soldierso he'sthey're all on theirand they're on their horses in their saddles. And there's three or four Indians in headdresses, and the Union soldiersand the Union soldiers are basically saying to the Indians: Come with me, we'll take care of you. We'lleverything will be good. And the Indian scoutthe Indian looks at John Wayne and points to the Union soldier and says, He's a lying, dog-faced pony soldier.Well, there's a lot of lying, dog-faced pony soldiers out there about global warming, but not anymore. All of a sudden, they're all realizing it's a problem. And there's nothing like seeing the light.Forand let's see. I'm just following my orders here.Staff, is there anybody I haven't spoken to?[] The President. No, I ain't calling on you. I'm calling onI said there were five questions. AnitaAnita from VOA.

Biden,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-president-yoon-suk-yeol-south-korea-and-prime-minister,1,"Q. Hi, I'm Jongjin Park of Money Today. First of all, I would like to ask a question to President Yoon Suk Yeol of the Republic of Korea. I heard that you stated that a new chapter has opened in our trilateral cooperation with the two countries. Compared to the previous summits, what would be the most significant outcome that you gained through this summit?And also, from the perspective of our people, what would be the benefit that the people of Korea would feel from these strengthening of ties?And now my question goes to President Biden. During this summit, the issues of detainees or prisoners of wars—and you mentioned that there will be further cooperation in these human rights issues. And you also said you will support the free and peaceful Korean Peninsula in the region. And what would—what kind of shift would there be in your policy? And what kind of specific solutions do you have in this regard?Lastly, I would like to direct my question to Prime Minister Kishida. Today we had a historic trilateral summit. However, there was much backlash and many concerns in Korea. However, President Yoon showed his political courage to do so. That's the international community's evaluation.However, there are still concerns that the—Japan is making very passive efforts to resolve our issues that still remain. And also, how would you be able to show your truthful willingness to resolve and improve our bilateral relations going forward?","First of all, this trilateral cooperation amongst our three countries has opened a new chapter, and we made that announcement today to talk about the differences from the past cooperation.For instance, in the past, it was about individual issues that we sought cooperation among ourselves. But now, as we have opened a new chapter in our cooperation for security, economy, science and technology, and development cooperation for the Global South, health, and women—across all of these issues, our three countries decided to closely work together. So it's much more comprehensive in nature.Such comprehensive cooperation has been launched by us today because currently we face complicated crisis and the threat from the D.P.R.K. And across the world, we believe that we can together make a contribution to freedom and peace around the world.So that is our foundational understanding and our common and shared interests of the three countries. And not just for exclusionary interests of ourselves. Our interests are well aligned with the universal interests of the members of the global community. That's where we find our shared interests lie.And at the same time, this framework of comprehensive cooperation among our three countries will contribute to global supply chain resilience, global financial market stability, cooperation in the frontier technology sectors and science.Our three countries together have the best-in-class expertise in science and technology. And we are the ones who are implementing liberal democracies. Naturally, progress in science and technologies will bring benefits—tangible benefits—to our people, not just in terms of security, but also in terms of economy and science and technology.But what is most important here is not about our own interests only. When we put our forces together, I believe that we can make a contribution to the advancement of freedom and peace in the world. And that's exactly where our interests are aligned. I—look, back in May of 2022, I met with the families of the Japanese abductees during my visit, heard their stories, and empathized with them and got a sense of the pain they're feeling. It's real.We know there are many families out there who still wait and worry and wonder. And we're not going to forget about them or their loved ones.And there's clear language on this on our joint statement. The bottom line is this: That we share a common position; we're committed to working together to see the return of all prisoners of war and those who've been abducted and detained.And by the way, one of the things we get asked many times—and it wasn't directly asked, but implied—is what makes us think any of this is positive. Success brings success. When other nations see cooperation in the region, they make judgments about: Would they be better off if they made commitments? Will they move?Think about—as students of history, all of you; and you are—think about how many times successes have generated other successes when you don't anticipate it.And so I just think this is a—we're not going to forget, we're not giving up, and we're going to continue to make the case for the freedom of all of those detainees. With regard to your question for me, first of all, I have strong feelings about strengthening bilateral relationships between the R.O.K. and Japan. I share that with The two countries, in dealing with international challenges, should cooperate. We're both important neighboring countries. And so friendship with President Yoon and a relationship of trust, based on this, both countries as partners should open up a new era. And that is my thinking.This year, President Yoon came to Japan, and I visited the R.O.K. At international fora, we have repeated meetings—we have had repeated meetings. And between our two countries, including the economy and security, we've had forward-looking and concrete approaches which were started. It's already in motion, dynamically.Economic security dialogue was started—or it has been decided on. In the area of export control, there have been progress. And also Financial Ministers and Defense Ministers have had meetings.And so we've had this very positive, forward-looking developments. And these are seen not only in the public sector. Also in the private sector, we see a slate of developments, human exchanges, and exchanges between business circles. We're seeing very active developments in all of these areas, and that is a reality.Going forward, we hope to accumulate these approaches with—along with President Yoon to strengthen our bilateral relations even further. By generating results, we hope that people will understand Japan's feelings towards our bilateral relations. And we'd like to continue such efforts.Thank you. Thank you very much.Then, let me see.

And you also said you will support the free and peaceful Korean Peninsula in the region. And what would—what kind of shift would there be in your policy? And what kind of specific solutions do you have in this regard?Lastly, I would like to direct my question to Prime Minister Kishida. Today we had a historic trilateral summit. However, there was much backlash and many concerns in Korea. However, President Yoon showed his political courage to do so. That's the international community's evaluation.However, there are still concerns that the—Japan is making very passive efforts to resolve our issues that still remain. And also, how would you be able to show your truthful willingness to resolve and improve our bilateral relations going forward?","First of all, this trilateral cooperation amongst our three countries has opened a new chapter, and we made that announcement today to talk about the differences from the past cooperation.For instance, in the past, it was about individual issues that we sought cooperation among ourselves. But now, as we have opened a new chapter in our cooperation for security, economy, science and technology, and development cooperation for the Global South, health, and women—across all of these issues, our three countries decided to closely work together. So it's much more comprehensive in nature.Such comprehensive cooperation has been launched by us today because currently we face complicated crisis and the threat from the D.P.R.K. And across the world, we believe that we can together make a contribution to freedom and peace around the world.So that is our foundational understanding and our common and shared interests of the three countries. And not just for exclusionary interests of ourselves. Our interests are well aligned with the universal interests of the members of the global community. That's where we find our shared interests lie.And at the same time, this framework of comprehensive cooperation among our three countries will contribute to global supply chain resilience, global financial market stability, cooperation in the frontier technology sectors and science.Our three countries together have the best-in-class expertise in science and technology. And we are the ones who are implementing liberal democracies. Naturally, progress in science and technologies will bring benefits—tangible benefits—to our people, not just in terms of security, but also in terms of economy and science and technology.But what is most important here is not about our own interests only. When we put our forces together, I believe that we can make a contribution to the advancement of freedom and peace in the world. And that's exactly where our interests are aligned. I—look, back in May of 2022, I met with the families of the Japanese abductees during my visit, heard their stories, and empathized with them and got a sense of the pain they're feeling. It's real.We know there are many families out there who still wait and worry and wonder. And we're not going to forget about them or their loved ones.And there's clear language on this on our joint statement. The bottom line is this: That we share a common position; we're committed to working together to see the return of all prisoners of war and those who've been abducted and detained.And by the way, one of the things we get asked many times—and it wasn't directly asked, but implied—is what makes us think any of this is positive. Success brings success. When other nations see cooperation in the region, they make judgments about: Would they be better off if they made commitments? Will they move?Think about—as students of history, all of you; and you are—think about how many times successes have generated other successes when you don't anticipate it.And so I just think this is a—we're not going to forget, we're not giving up, and we're going to continue to make the case for the freedom of all of those detainees. With regard to your question for me, first of all, I have strong feelings about strengthening bilateral relationships between the R.O.K. and Japan. I share that with The two countries, in dealing with international challenges, should cooperate. We're both important neighboring countries. And so friendship with President Yoon and a relationship of trust, based on this, both countries as partners should open up a new era. And that is my thinking.This year, President Yoon came to Japan, and I visited the R.O.K. At international fora, we have repeated meetings—we have had repeated meetings. And between our two countries, including the economy and security, we've had forward-looking and concrete approaches which were started. It's already in motion, dynamically.Economic security dialogue was started—or it has been decided on. In the area of export control, there have been progress. And also Financial Ministers and Defense Ministers have had meetings.And so we've had this very positive, forward-looking developments. And these are seen not only in the public sector. Also in the private sector, we see a slate of developments, human exchanges, and exchanges between business circles. We're seeing very active developments in all of these areas, and that is a reality.Going forward, we hope to accumulate these approaches with—along with President Yoon to strengthen our bilateral relations even further.

So that is not about whether or not they should or shouldn't join. It's about when they can join. And they will join NATO.The issue of whether or not this is going to keep Putin from continuing to fight, the answer is: Putin has already lost the war. Putin has a real problem. How does he move from here? What does he do? And so the idea that there's going to be—what vehicle is used, he could end the war tomorrow; he could just say, I'm out.But what agreement is ultimately reached depends upon Putin and what he decides to do. But there is no possibility of him winning the war in Ukraine. He's already lost that war. Imagine if—even if—anyway. He's already lost that war.","The question consists of 3 parts:

But first, a two-part question for you: Your comments at a fundraiser this week appear to be the first time in recent memory that a sitting U.S. President has called a Chinese leader a dictator. Did those comments about President Xi undermine or complicate the progress your administration has made in maintaining a relationship with China?And secondly, on India: As you raise these broader issues of human rights and democracy, what is your message to those, including some members of your own party, who say that your administration is overlooking the targeting of religious minorities and crackdown on dissent in Prime Minister Modi's country?","The answer to your first question is: No. You know, what—when we're talking to our allies and partners around the world, including India, we let the idea of my choosing and avoiding saying what I think is the facts with regard to the relationship with India—with China is—just not something I'm going to change very much.I think we—I believe that—and I've said this for some time—that the hysteria about the relationship with China is collapsing and moving, et cetera, et cetera—we had an incident that caused some confusion, you might say. But President—but Secretary Blinken had a great trip to China. I expect to be meeting with President Xi sometime in the future, in the near term. And I don't think it's had any real consequence.And what was your second question?","The question consists of 2 parts:

1. Did the comments about President Xi undermine or complicate the progress made in maintaining a relationship with China?
2. What is the message to those who say the administration is overlooking the targeting of religious minorities and crackdown on dissent in Prime Minister Modi's country?

The response provides the following information regarding these points:

1. The answer to the first question is ""No."" The President states that when talking to allies and partners, including India, he chooses to say what he thinks are the facts regarding the relationship with China.

And what do you say to parents, like the ones that I spoke to, to those families who are contemplating leaving the country because they don't feel safe anymore?And then, Prime—Prime Minister Sunak, thank you.

What are the U.S. and the U.K.—what is the U.K. doing with the U.S. to protect elections and democracy from AI-generated disinformation campaigns waged at scale by foreign actors?And you also mentioned the warning letter sent by AI leaders about the potential threat that this technology, if misused, can pose to humanity. How is regulating artificial intelligence going to be any different than what has been done at the global scale, so far, to deal with climate change, another existential threat?","Let me answer your first question.

It matters a great deal how we treat everyone in this country.And the fact is that I'm announcing today a series of new initiatives that we're taking to protect the LGBT community. I was going to do this at the fore out on South Lawn. We're having Pride Day, but we're going to have to postpone it because of the climate, because of the weather and the pollution out there because of the fires.But number one, we're going to strengthen the physical safety, dedicated resources, the Federal coordination to better protect Pride celebrations, marches, community centers, health care providers, and small businesses.Secondly, we're addressing civil rights violations, a new coordinator to protect LGBT students from book bans, which make it harder for kids to learn and may violate their civil rights at the same time.We're also engaging in mental health and other supports, more mental health resources and funding to help families support their kids, new efforts to protect LGBTQ kids in foster care, and steps to end—the absolute end of LGBTQ homelessness.Congress has to pass—and I'm not giving up on this. Just like they told me we couldn't get Marriage Act passed. Congress must pass—must pass—the Equality Act and send it to my desk.LGBTQ Americans, especially children: You're loved, you're heard, and this administration has your back, and I mean it.

And we are aligned in wanting to discuss with other countries what those guardrails should be.I think here in the U.S., you've convened all the companies together recently; we've done the same in Downing Street just a couple of weeks ago. And I think there are a series of measures that we can implement working cooperatively, as we have been discussing, that will ensure that we can enjoy the benefits of this technology whilst mitigating against their risks. And that's what our citizens would expect.And you talk about climate change. You know, we come together at COP to work multilaterally across multiple countries to bring down carbon emissions, to get funding to the countries that need it, to share research on how we can develop the green technologies of the future. Indeed, that's part of our conversations and agreement today.And we need to bring that same spirit of urgency, I think, to the challenges and opportunities that AI poses, because the pace of the technological change is faster than people had anticipated.

The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of the United Kingdom,"June 08, 2023",Joseph R. Biden,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-rishi-sunak-the-united-kingdom,1,"Q. [Laughter] Yes, they're holding on to it.Laura Barrón-López with the PBS NewsHour. All over the country, Mr. President, Republican-led States are passing laws—passing anti-LGBTQ, antitransgender laws that restrict rights and medical care. Intimidation is on the rise. This week, anti-LGBTQ protesters turned violent in California.And also, recently, I spoke to the parents of a transgender girl in Texas who told me that they're afraid and that they are considering leaving not just their State, but the country.Sir, why do you think this is happening? And what do you say to parents, like the ones that I spoke to, to those families who are contemplating leaving the country because they don't feel safe anymore?And then, Prime—Prime Minister Sunak, thank you. You mentioned that AI has been a key part of your visit. What are the U.S. and the U.K.—what is the U.K. doing with the U.S. to protect elections and democracy from AI-generated disinformation campaigns waged at scale by foreign actors?And you also mentioned the warning letter sent by AI leaders about the potential threat that this technology, if misused, can pose to humanity. How is regulating artificial intelligence going to be any different than what has been done at the global scale, so far, to deal with climate change, another existential threat?","Let me answer your first question. First of all, maybe quietly, when we finish this, you can give me the number of that family, and I will call them and let them know that the President and this administration has their back. And I mean that.Look, as President, I was proud to end the ban on transgender troops in our military, sign the Respect for Marriage Act, strengthen the civil rights protections for LBGT Americans, and advance LGBT human rights around the globe.But our fight is far, far from over because we have some hysterical and, I would argue, prejudiced people who are engaged in all of what you see going on around the country. It's an appeal to fear, and it's an appeal that is totally, thoroughly unjustified and ugly.It's wrong for—that a person can be married in the morning in the United States and fired in the afternoon by their employer because they are—they're gay. It's wrong that the violence and hate crimes targeting LGBTQ people is rising. It's wrong that extreme officials are pushing hateful bills targeting transgender children, terrifying families, and criminalizing doctors.These are our kids. These are our neighbors. It's cruel and it's callous. Not somebody else's kids; they're all our kids. They're the kids—and our children are the kite strings that hold our national ambitions aloft. It matters a great deal how we treat everyone in this country.And the fact is that I'm announcing today a series of new initiatives that we're taking to protect the LGBT community. I was going to do this at the fore out on South Lawn. We're having Pride Day, but we're going to have to postpone it because of the climate, because of the weather and the pollution out there because of the fires.But number one, we're going to strengthen the physical safety, dedicated resources, the Federal coordination to better protect Pride celebrations, marches, community centers, health care providers, and small businesses.Secondly, we're addressing civil rights violations, a new coordinator to protect LGBT students from book bans, which make it harder for kids to learn and may violate their civil rights at the same time.We're also engaging in mental health and other supports, more mental health resources and funding to help families support their kids, new efforts to protect LGBTQ kids in foster care, and steps to end—the absolute end of LGBTQ homelessness.Congress has to pass—and I'm not giving up on this. Just like they told me we couldn't get Marriage Act passed. Congress must pass—must pass—the Equality Act and send it to my desk.LGBTQ Americans, especially children: You're loved, you're heard, and this administration has your back, and I mean it. We are not relenting one single second to make sure that they're protected. Laura, the—on your question, it's clear that AI can bring incredible and will bring incredible benefits to society, our economies, to all of us. And actually, one of your leading venture capitalists just published an essay on this, which made the point very eloquently yesterday.And it's also clear, though, that it does pose very real risks that we, as leaders, need to be cognizant of and put in place the guardrails to mitigate against.Actually, President Biden and I had a very good conversation on this just a couple of weeks ago in Japan in one of our sessions in Hiroshima. And we are aligned in wanting to discuss with other countries what those guardrails should be.I think here in the U.S., you've convened all the companies together recently; we've done the same in Downing Street just a couple of weeks ago. And I think there are a series of measures that we can implement working cooperatively, as we have been discussing, that will ensure that we can enjoy the benefits of this technology whilst mitigating against their risks. And that's what our citizens would expect.And you talk about climate change. You know, we come together at COP to work multilaterally across multiple countries to bring down carbon emissions, to get funding to the countries that need it, to share research on how we can develop the green technologies of the future. Indeed, that's part of our conversations and agreement today.And we need to bring that same spirit of urgency, I think, to the challenges and opportunities that AI poses, because the pace of the technological change is faster than people had anticipated. And I think the letter that you mentioned kind of reminded us that we do need to work urgently to address this issue. And I'm delighted that Joe and I and others will be doing that with all great haste.And I think a couple of questions on our end. Could I call on the BBC?","The question consists of 4 parts:

Biden,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-with-prime-minister-rishi-sunak-the-united-kingdom,3,"Q. It was about: Is the new Washington consensus that you and your National Security Adviser set out simply another way of saying America first, which some overseas think it is?","Well, look, my economic policy is totally consistent with what I think is in the interest of our NATO allies and our allies around the world.One of the things that I decided to do—and I find that the Wall Street Journal—and I'm sure there is someone here from the Wall Street Journal and other publications that are talking about Bidenomics. I didn't realize it was—I had Bidenomics going.But the bottom line was this: that the fundamental changes taking place in terms of international trade, nobody in—at least very few people in United States, and I suspect around the world, knew what a supply chain meant, what they're talking about, the supply chain.When we found out during the pandemic that the reason why we couldn't build automobiles was because the outfit that we got our semiconductors from in Southeast Asia had shut down because of the pandemic, we realized that—I decided that no longer would we rely on one center of support for any of the things that are needed for our economic growth.And I made it clear to all our NATO allies and our partners as well that although we were going to generate a—for example, an AI capacity here—I mean, excuse me, a semiconductor capacity here in the United States, attracting literally several hundred billion dollars in investment, that that was available to all of our allies, all of our friends. And they're investing as they—as we are and benefiting in a similar way.The bottom line here for me is that I think that the world is changing in a way that globalization is still real. But the measure of what we used to call in the United States trickle-down economics, where if the—if the trickle-down economics resulted in both—in Democratic and Republican administrations for generations—in making sure we found the cheapest labor in the world, sent the product to—sent the work to those—to that neighbor or those neighbors who have the cheapest labor, and they send back their products.Well, I'm not doing that anymore. We're going to make sure that we, in fact, have a flip of that. We're sending capacity—here in the United States, we're attracting capacity to build here in the United States to send product overseas, not the reverse.And I know it sounds simplistic, but it's working so far. And it's not going to hurt any of our allies or friends in terms of the trade piece of this. Matter of fact, I'm finding they're benefiting from it as well, because they're engaging in it with us. And at home, they're doing similar things.So that's why we talked about the need to have relationships in terms of certain materials—the battery technologies—to share. We rely on Great Britain to produce a lot of that for us.So it is increasing trade. But right now it looks like it is—because the United States is doing so incredibly well, it makes it looks like it's only the United States. It's not. It's just a change in direction in terms of how we view generating economic growth. And just to add to that, I'd say I'm absolutely of the view that the United States, this President does not believe in zero-sum competition amongst allies. That's what we declared together with our G-7 partners just a few weeks ago in Hiroshima. This is a President and an administration that is completely attuned to the needs and concerns of its allies on these issues. And you can see that.Today, as the President said, we are launching negotiations between the U.K. and the U.S. on a critical minerals agreement so that the U.S. can provide us with that interaction and cooperation we need.And the Atlantic Declaration that we've announced today just talks about strengthening, deepening our cooperation. It's not about looking in and being protection; it's about the exact opposite of that.And it's about strengthening that cooperation across the full spectrum of economic, technological, and other spheres. And that's what you will see. You'll see that from the President. You'll see it from me. You'll see the U.K. and the U.S. working even more closely together on all the big economic issues of our time, because that's what the moment demands, and that's what our citizens need us to do. And that's what the President and I plan to deliver. And it's not just our citizens. Look, the Global South—there are going to be a billion people in Africa very shortly. One billion.At the G-7, it was originally called Build Back Better World, but we were talking about—there's a new PPI [PGII; White House correction]—anyway—an industrial policy that we're all signed on to, to provide the countries in Africa and in the Global South an opportunity to grow, significantly grow, which benefits the United States, benefits Europe, benefits every country.Because the reverse is true: If we don't figure a way in which these countries can grow and participate and have to—and be able to build infrastructure—you know, the Canadians—the—excuse me, the Chinese have a Belt and Road Initiative. Well, the Belt and Road Initiative turns out to be a debt and confiscation program. Not going very far.But what we're doing—and we're going to be doing with our NATO allies, with the G-7—is providing opportunities. For example, Angola—I—should be in a position very soon to have the largest solar facility in the world, generating significant amounts of energy. It benefits us, benefits them, brings them into the 21st century in a way that they'd never been before.We're talking about building—and I had my team putting together with other countries as well—to build a railroad from the Pacific Ocean—from the Atlantic Ocean all the way to the Indian Ocean. Never occurred before. How—we're—our Departments of Agriculture are working with these countries.So there's a significant amount of cooperation, not to hoard capacity, but to expand capacity to further expand opportunity, because we all benefit from it.And one thing I've learned is that we are not going to be able to deal with the global warming, which is a consequential—single most consequential threat to humanity if we don't do it, unless we engage more together, not fewer—not less together.And so the United States will do what it can do well and invite all of our partners to be part of it if we can.Thank you. Thank you.","The question consists of 1 part:

Thank you, Mr. President. You spoke a moment ago about what you won't do in terms of your negotiations with Republicans. But I'm interested in what you've signaled you already might do. In particular, by conceding in these negotiations to some form of a cap or freezing spending, are you concerned that Mr. McCarthy has already forced you into accepting a policy position that could tip this economy into a recession?","No, I don't believe that's the case at all. As a matter of fact, I think that we can reach an agreement.

I'm willing to cut spending, and I proposed cuts in spending of over a trillion dollars.But I believe we have to also look at the tax revenues. The idea that the—my Republican colleagues want to continue the $2 trillion tax cut that had profound negative impacts on the economy from the Trump administration.

Zero. And so we said, You've got to pay a minimum of 15 percent taxes. What a horrible thing. You're paying more than 15 percent in taxes, every one of you out there.And so guess what? We not only balanced the budget; we were able to reduce the deficit by $1.7 billion [trillion; White House correction]. And so there's a lot of things that they refuse to look at in terms of tax generation as well as what kind of people we're going to increase taxes for.And like I said, we're now down to—we went from somewhere—roughly 740 billionaires to about 1,000 billionaires in America. They're paying an average tax rate of 8 percent. Raise your hand if you want to pay 8 percent only. I think you'd all be ready to do that.So my point is that there's a lot of things that they refuse to entertain, and they just said revenue is off the table. Well, revenue is not off the table.

"The President's News Conference in Hiroshima, Japan","May 21, 2023",Joseph R. Biden,https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/the-presidents-news-conference-hiroshima-japan,2,Q. But you don't think the spending cuts themselves will cause a recession?,"I know they won't. I know they won't.Matter of fact, the fact that we were able to cut Government spending by $1.7 trillion, that didn't cause a recession; that caused growth. Look, we have the lowest unemployment rate in over 50 years. We've created 12-point—I think it's—7 million new jobs, including 800,000 manufacturing jobs. We have moved in a direction where we're rebuilding and reconstructing America through the infrastructure act.Look, here's the other thing. I'm sure—I'm not sure; my guess is, I'll get a question about, you know, Well, wait a minute, you know, the American people aren't satisfied. Well, guess what? As I've told you all before, most of this—what we've passed—doesn't kick in—it only kicks in over time. And so the fact is, for example, that if you're in a situation where you were—I'll give you the one example that I've used—everybody understands the easiest—is insulin.Well, I decided that we were going to be in a position where we were not going to continue to pay the highest drug prices in the world. And that's what we do, by the way. Same manufacturer of a drug in the United States, selling it here in Japan, selling it in Tokyo, or selling it in Berlin, or selling it around the world, they pay a lot less than we pay at home.So we said a simple proposition: Let's take a look at how much it costs to make the product. And I'm not going to ask you to—a show of hands like I do in a town meeting, but if—I usually ask, How many people know somebody who has type 1 or type 2 diabetes? And I'm almost—at least half the audience raises their hand.Well, they were paying somewhere between $4- and $700 a month for their insulin that they badly need to stay healthy and alive. Well, guess what? It costs $10—t-e-n—$10 to make. To package, total amount, you could argue maybe as much as $13.Well, guess what? Now they can't charge more for—Medicare can't, because Medicare is paying—taking American tax dollars and paying for the elderly's health care needs. You can't charge more than $35 for that drug. That saves $160 billion. Hear it? A hundred and sixty billion dollars less will be paid out by the Federal—by the American taxpayer to help the elderly people on Medicare with a problem.Well, a lot of this is just kicking in. We're in a situation where next year, for the drug costs, no senior will have to pay—total cost—total cost of all the drugs, from expensive cancer drugs to whatever drugs they're taking, will not have to pay more than $3,500 a year. The following year—we've already passed this. This is the law now. The following year, they won't have to pay more than $2,000. That saves another $200 billion that we're paying out.But the other team won't count this. Even though it's the law—we passed it—they won't count that as reducing the debt.So there's a lot of those kinds of disagreements we have. And my guess is that I'm going to be talking to the Speaker of the House on the way back on the plane, because it will be morning time over—at home. And I'm going to be in that plane in about an hour or so. And my guess is, he's going to want to deal directly with me in making sure we're all on the same page.But it's probably more than you wanted to know.How about Masaru, NHK [Masaru Takagi; NHK World].","The question consists of 1 part: ""But you don't think the spending cuts themselves will cause a recession?""

The response provides the following information regarding this point:
- The President states that he knows the spending cuts won't cause a recession.
- He mentions that the $1.7 trillion cut in government spending has not caused a recession, but instead, it has led to growth.
- He emphasizes the low unemployment rate and the creation of millions of new jobs, including manufacturing jobs.
- The President also talks about the infrastructure act and how it is contributing to the rebuilding and reconstruction of America.
- He addresses potential concerns about public satisfaction, explaining that most of what has been passed takes time to have an impact.
- He gives the example of reducing the cost of insulin and how it is saving the American taxpayer billions of dollars.
- The President mentions future measures to limit drug costs for seniors under Medicare and the savings that will result.
- He mentions disagreements with the other team and the need to align with the Speaker of the House.
