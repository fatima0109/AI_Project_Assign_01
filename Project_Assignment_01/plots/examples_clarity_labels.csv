Clear Reply,How would you respond to the accusation that the United States is containing China while pushing for diplomatic talks?,"Well, look, first of all, theI am sincere about getting the relationship right. And one of the things that is going on now is, China is beginning to change some of the rules of the game, in terms of trade and other issues.And so one of the things we talked about, for example, is that they're now talking about making sure that no Chineseno one in the Chinese Government can use a Western cell phone. Those kinds of things.And so, really, what this trip was aboutit was less about containing China. I don't want to contain China. I just want to make sure that we have a relationship with China that is on the up and up, squared away, everybody knows what it's all about. And one of the ways you do that is, you make sure that we are talking about the same things.And I think that one of the things we've doneI've tried to do, and I've talked with a number of my staff about this for the last, I guess, 6 monthsis, we have an opportunity to strengthen alliances around the world to maintain stability.That's what this trip was all about: having India cooperate much more with the United States, be closer with the United States, Vietnam being closer with the United States. It's not about containing China; it's about having a stable base, a stable base in the Indo-Pacific.And it'sfor example, when I was spending a lot of time talking with President Xi, he asked why we were doingwhy was I going to have the Quad, meaning Australia, India, Japan, and the United States? And I said, To maintain stability. It's not about isolating China. It's about making sure the rules of the roadeverything from airspace and space in the ocean isthe international rules of the road are abided by.And soand I hope thatI think that Prime Minister XiI mean, Xi has somesome difficulties right now. All countries end up with difficulties, and he had some economic difficulties he's working his way through. I want to see China succeed economically, but I want to see them succeed by the rules.The next question was to Bloomberg."
Clear Reply, Is the President's engagement with Asian countries a sign of a cold war mentality?,"Well, I hope I get to see Mr. Xi sooner than later. I've spent more time with him than any other world leader has, sum total, over the last 12 years. So I hope we get to see him again soon.But no, lookfor example, one of the things we did in India: We provided for a new path that's going to save everybody money, increase the Third Worldthe Third Worldthe Global South's capacity to grow by sendingwe're going tofromwe're going to have a new railroad from India all the way across to the Mediterranean, new shipping lanes and pipelines across the Mediterranean through Europe, up into Great Britain and beyond.That's all about economic growth. That has nothing to do with hurting China or helping China. It has to do with dealing with everything from climate change to making sure that these countries can succeed economically and grow.Look, my thesis has been, from the beginning, both domestically and in terms of foreign policy: Invest in your people. Invest in the people. Give them a chance.Everything is better off when peopleI know it's going to sound trite. If everybody in the world had a job they get up in the morning and wanted to go to and thought theyand they could put three squares in the table for their family, no matter where they live, the whole world be better off. We'd be a lot better. That's the notion here behind this.For example, you know, one of the things we're doing in terms ofI proposed a long time ago at the G-7, now it'sthat's going to come to fruition at the G-20, is making sure that we build a railroad all the way across the African Continent. Think about it. There is no way to cross the African Continent by roadby rail. And there's not even a direct highway across.Now, let's assume for the sake of discussionwhen we talk about food shortagesassume there was one country in that vast continent that had aan excess of foodstuffs and resources. How would they get it to where they're going to go? How are they going to do it?That's why we're also going to invest billions of dollars in solar facilities in Angola to have the largestthe largest solar facility in the worldamong the largest. That helps Angola, but it also helps the whole region.So I think we think too much in terms of cold war terms. It's not about that. It's about generating economic growth and stability in all parts of the world. And that's what we're trying to do.Sorry. Okay. Am I pronouncing itAuvelia [Aurelia; White House correction]? Did I pronounce the name correctly? There you are."
Clear Reply," Concerns about the lack of communication between the interviewee and President Xi of China, and the potential destabilization of the U.S.-China relationship.","It's not a wedge issue of the Global South. It's a wedge issue with Russia, which was present, and with China, which was presentwhich washad the representation.And soand by the way, I am amy team, my staff still meets with President Xi's people and his Cabinet, in effect; I met with his number-two person here inexcuse me, in India today.So it's not like there's a crisis if I don't personally speak to him. It would be better if I did, but I thinklook, this is not a criticism; it's an observation: He has his hands full right now. He has overwhelming unemployment with his youth. One of the major economic tenets of his plan isn't working at all right now. I'm not happy for that. But it's not working.So he's trying to figure out, I suspectI don't knowjust like I would, trying to figure out what to do about the particular crisis they're having now.But I don't think it's a crisis relating to conflict between China and the United States. As a matter of fact, I think it's less likely to cause that kind of conflict. I don'tanyway, I just think that there are other things on leaders' minds, and they respond to what's needed at the time.And look, nobody likes having celebrated international meetings if you don't know what you want at the meeting, if you don't have a game plan. He may have a game plan; he just hasn't shared it with me.But I tell you what, I don't know about you, but I'm going to go to bed."
Ambivalent,Do you think President Xi is being sincere about getting the relationship back on track as he bans Apple in China?,"Well, look, first of all, theI am sincere about getting the relationship right.

Ambivalent," Do you believe the country's slowdown and growth could risk destabilizing the global economy or cause China to be more aggressive defensively, including with Taiwan?","Look, I think China has a difficult economic problem right now for a whole range of reasons that relate to the international growth and lack thereof and the policies that China has followed.And so I don't think it's going to cause China to invade Taiwan. And matter of fact, the opposite: It probably doesn't have the same capacity that it had before.But as I said, I'm notwe're not looking to hurt China, sincerely. We're all better off if China does well, if China does well by the international rules. It grows the economy.But they have had some real difficulty in terms of their economy of late, particularly in real estate. Asidethat end of their bargain. And I think the actions that they're going to have to take are ones that arethey're in the process of deciding right now. And I'm not going to predict what way it will come out. But we're not looking to decouple from China.What I'm not going to do is, I'm not going to sell China material that would enhance their capacity to make more nuclear weapons, to engage in defense activities that are contrary to what is viewed as most people would think was a positive development in the region.Andbut we're not trying to hurt China.Okay. Let'sBBC. Laura. Am I correct? Is that correctLaura?"

Clear Non-Reply,What did you talk about with him?,"We talked about what we talked about at the conference overall. We talked about stability.

Clear Non-Reply, Does the firing of the general and the rebellion by Prigozhin indicate any potential future actions by Putin?,"Well, first of all, they already interfered in American elections. So that would not be anything new. They did that last time—they tried to.But with regard to—I don't think there's any real prospect—you never know—but of Putin using nuclear weapons. Not only has the West, but China and the rest of the world has said: That's—don't go there. Don't go there. Number two.Number three, I think that determining what happens to Prigozhin and what happens to Vilnius—I mean—excuse me, what happens when we discussed this in Vilnius is, God only knows what he's likely to do. Well, I'm not even sure—we're not even sure where he is and what relationship he has. If I were he, I'd be careful what I ate. I'd be keeping my eye on my menu.But all kidding aside, I who knows? I don't know. I don't think any of us know for sure what the future of Prigozhin is in Russia. And so I don't know how to answer that question beyond that."
Clear Non-Reply,What is the message to those who say the administration is overlooking the targeting of religious minorities and crackdown on dissent in Prime Minister Modi's country?,"The answer to your first question is: No. You know, what—when we're talking to our allies and partners around the world, including India, we let the idea of my choosing and avoiding saying what I think is the facts with regard to the relationship with India—with China is—just not something I'm going to change very much.I think we—I believe that—and I've said this for some time—that the hysteria about the relationship with China is collapsing and moving, et cetera, et cetera—we had an incident that caused some confusion, you might say. But President—but Secretary Blinken had a great trip to China. I expect to be meeting with President Xi sometime in the future, in the near term. And I don't think it's had any real consequence.And what was your second question?"
